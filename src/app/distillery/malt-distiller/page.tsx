      <p>
        Errol Wings 3 Year Old Single Malt is crafted with spirit sourced from an established
        Scottish malt distillery operating traditional copper pot stills.
      </p>
      <p>
        The new make spirit is filled into quality oak casks and matured in Scotland for not less
        than three years, in full compliance with Scotch whisky regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our collaboration focuses on consistency, clarity of style and a flavour profile suited to
        contemporary international markets, while remaining authentic to its Scottish origin.

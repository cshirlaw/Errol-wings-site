      <h1>Errol Wings — The Story</h1>

      <h2>Top Secret Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Errol Wings Single Malt Scotch Whisky is inspired by a little-known chapter of the Second World War.
        In 1942, aircraft were secretly ferried from Britain towards the Eastern Front.
        The small Scottish town of Errol, with its airfield on the banks of the Tay, played a role as a training
        and transit point on this route.
      </p>
      <p>
        The brand does not romanticise war. Instead, it recognises the skill, discipline and cooperation shown by
        crews and ground staff who worked in difficult conditions, often without recognition.
      </p>

      <h2>Worthy of Their Memory</h2>
      <p>
        Errol Wings is presented as a whisky that preserves the memory of shared effort and the desire for peace.
        The name symbolises people who acted with courage and professionalism, and nations that stood together against
        a common threat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, the Errol Wings range is focused on clear, honest Scotch whisky made for contemporary drinkers —
        drawing on this history as context, not spectacle.
